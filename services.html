    What I don't do:
</h4>
<ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
    <li>I don't offer graphic design services, as I'm not a graphic artist.</li>
    <li>I don't provide web hosting; I use third-party hosting platforms.</li>
    <li>I don't create 3D models, as I'm not a 3D artist.</li>
    <li>I don't manage custom domain names of a website. Client will provide the domain or use default ones like <u>netlify.app</u> or <u>vercel.app</u>.</li>
    <li>I don't take on long-term projects (over 2 months); I focus on short-term tasks.</li>
    <li>I don't develop games.</li>
    <li>I don't design logo as it will be provided by the client.</li>
    <li>I don't assess system/network vulnerabilities; I'm not a cybersecurity professional.</li>
    <li>I do not handle legal paperwork or compliance-related documents for projects, except for the project contract which I will provide. Clients are responsible for managing these aspects on their own.</li>
