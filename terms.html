    Payment Terms
</h4>
<ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2 mb-4">
    <li>I require a <b>downpayment</b> before starting any project. The amount will be discussed and agreed upon in advance (Typically 50%).</li>
    <li>For direct transactions via private message (PM) or direct message (DM), I only accept payments through <b>Online Banking</b> or <b>GCash</b>.</li>
    <li>For platform-based transactions, such as <b>Freelancer.com</b> or <b>Upwork</b>, I strictly follow and comply with the payment and policy terms set by the respective platform.</li>
    <li>Failure to complete the full payment after repeated reminders may result in appropriate legal action being taken.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Internal Affairs
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  If the client represents a company, I require a clear understanding of the process, particularly regarding payments. 
  I also reserve the right to verify the client's identity by requesting a valid ID.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Feasibility
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  I reserve the right to decline a project if the timeline or budget provided by the client is deemed unreasonable.
  A project will only commence once both parties agree on the scope and deadline.
  I require a project contract to avoid conflicts and legal consequences before development begins.
  The contract will be provided by me and must be accepted by the client.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Scope
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  As a web developer, my work is limited to developing these types of systems and does not include:
  tracing, reverse code engineering, making graphics, drawing, audio recording, image production, file safe-keeping, project backups, legalities, paperworks, etc... as also stated in my <b>What I don't do</b> page.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Ownership, Confidentiality & Intellectual Property
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  All project-related materials will remain confidential and will not be shared, published, or made open-source without the client's explicit permission, unless the content is clearly intended for public release.
  Ownership of the project—including source code and deliverables—will be fully transferred to the client only after complete payment has been received.
  Until then, the entire project is my intellectual property.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Changes
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  I only accept a maximum of 2 major revisions or changes during project development to avoid affecting project quality and deadline.
  Any changes or revisions will increase project price.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Delayed Payment
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  A payment that is not made by the due date on the invoice is considered a delayed payment and will incur an additional daily charge.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Warranty & Support
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  I provide a limited support period of up to <b>3 days</b> after the final delivery of the project.
  During this time, I will fix any bugs or technical issues related to the delivered product at no additional cost.
  This warranty does not cover new feature requests, design changes, or issues caused by modifications made by the client or third parties.
  After the 3-day period, any support, updates, or revisions will be considered as separate billable tasks and will incur additional charges.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Working Hours
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  As a college student, I strive to balance my education with my freelance work.
  I typically work during evenings and weekends, but please note that project timelines may be affected by my academic schedule.
  I typically dedicate 2-3 hours on days with half-day classes, and limited to no time on full academic days.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Deployment
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  Deployment services require a monthly fee. 
  Clients are responsible for providing their own custom domain. 
  If no domain is provided, a default domain such as
  <u>.netlify.app</u> or 
  <u>.vercel.app</u> will be used. 
  Failure to pay the monthly fee will result in the site becoming non-functional.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Termination
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  If a client violates the agreed terms after payment, I may suspend or terminate the project without refund to protect both parties.
</p>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Overall Process
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-2">
  The overall process is as follows (for DM-to-DM or PM-to-PM transactions) <br/>
  <i>(Note: this may vary depending on the platform)</i>:
</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-outside ml-6 mb-4 [&>li]:mt-2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>I, as the developer, will first evaluate the project's feasibility based on the feasibility Google Form submitted by the client.</li>
  <li>If the project is deemed feasible, I will issue a project contract, which the client must review and agree to before development begins.</li>
  <li>Once the client agrees to the contract, a wireframe would be provided.</li>
  <li>A wireframe design will be provided:
	<ul class="list-disc" style="margin-left:1rem;">
		<li>If the client chose to provide their own wireframe design, I will copy it.</li>
		<li>If not, I will provide a wireframe design.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the wireframe design is approved, the client must provide a downpayment.</li>
  <li>Once the downpayment is received, project development starts. Note: I strongly advise against making changes during development as it can impact quality, cost, and timeline.</li>
  <li>After development is completed, I can issue a formal quotation upon request, detailing the full project cost breakdown.</li>
  <li>Failure to settle payment by the quotation's deadline may result in additional fees or project termination, and the downpayment will be non-refundable.</li>
  <li>Upon full payment, I can issue a service invoice if requested by the client.</li>
  <li>Enjoy your new system.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="scroll-m-20 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
  Conflict & Resolution
</h4>
<p class="leading-7 mb-4">
  In the event of a conflict, these terms will serve as the primary reference for resolution.
  If any inconsistencies arise between these terms and other documentation or communication,
  these terms shall take precedence unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties.
